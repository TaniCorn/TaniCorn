# Hi I'm Tanapat, a programmer with a love for learning!

## A bit about me

I'm a games programmer primarily working in unreal C++ nowadays, but I still do Unity every now and then. When I'm not doing games programming, I'm doing low-level programming to learn, research and practice subsets like graphics, networking, proceduralism etc.


Here's my [Portfolio](https://tanapats6.wixsite.com/tanapatsomrid) and [Itch.io](https://tanicorn.itch.io/)

## Current Works
- I'm currently working on a Unity contract which I can't make public just yet
- I'm trying to help out some other repo's, and I'm thinking of doing something for open source
- I'm going to undertake some graphics projects with DX12 and Vulkan soon

## Best Works
