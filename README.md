# Hi I'm Tanapat, a programmer with a love for learning!

## A bit about me

I'm graduating Abertay Unviersity with a Computer Games Technology BSc Hons Degree. I'm done 30+ projects, mostly games. I'm really interested in Graphics, Gameplay, and Networking Programming.

I'm looking forward to learning more about Tools Programming, Tech Art, Animation Programming, and Audio Programming.

- 📫 Send me an email at Tanapat.s@hotmail.com
- Here's my [Portfolio](https://tanapats6.wixsite.com/website) and [Itch.io](https://tanicorn.itch.io/)
- ⚡ Fun fact: My favourite animal is a [Pyrosome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPkakSsbGYw&t=2s), it's a glowy collection of organisms. It looks like it's from another planet!

## Current Works
- I’m currently working on my [Honours Project](https://github.com/TaniCorn/Honours) focusing on Graphics Programming
- My latest work was [Search For A Star 2024](https://github.com/TaniCorn/sfas-2024) <- CHECK IT OUT!
